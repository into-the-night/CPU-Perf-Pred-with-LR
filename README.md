**CPU Performance Predictor**

My first ML project: Using Single and Multi Variate Linear Regression, predicts the CPU performances based on various Features (like Maximum Memory, Cache etc.)

Here's a plot of maximum memory of a CPU vs its actual and predicted performance.

_Uses matplotlib for plotting data._
_Uses scikit-learn for Linear Regression models._
